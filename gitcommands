git add -A //adds all files in the directory to git repo
git commit -m 'add projectx' //commits an added file change with an 
appended message 'projectx' in this case

git push // pushes the commited files and directories to your git repository 

git pull //  this is used to fetch the changes made in the git repo to the local 
git directory (acts as an update)
